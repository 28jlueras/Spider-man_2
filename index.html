    <p2> i am a 13 year old 8 grade student named Jeremiah Lueras. I am into soccer movies,video games and comic books. i love to hang with my friends. What i like more is to go on trips with my family. Enjoy my website and buy Spider man 2.P.S. the reason for the pink it sticks out and its easy to read. </p2>
